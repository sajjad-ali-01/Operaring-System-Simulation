# OSProject Summary

## Overview
The OSProject is a Java application that simulates various operations related to operating system functionalities. It provides modules for process management, process scheduling, memory management, I/O management, and other system operations.

## Features
- **Process Management:** Create, destroy, suspend, resume, block, and manage processes.
- **Process Scheduling:** Perform scheduling algorithms like FCFS (First Come, First Serve) on simulated processes.
- **Memory Management:** (You can add details if applicable)
- **I/O Management:** (You can add details if applicable)
- **Other Operations:** (You can add details if applicable)

## Components
### Process Management
- Allows users to create processes with specific IDs, arrival times, and burst times.
- Provides options to delete, suspend, resume, and block processes.
- Displays tables for ready processes and blocked/suspended processes.

### Process Scheduling
- Supports scheduling algorithms like FCFS.
- And some are UnderDeveloping
- Calculates completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for processes.

### How to Run
- Compile the Java file (`OSProject.java`).
- Run the compiled class file to execute the program.

## Usage
- Users can navigate through the main menu to access different modules.
- Use buttons to perform operations like creating processes, scheduling, and managing system components.

## Dependencies
- This project utilizes Swing for the GUI (Graphical User Interface) components.
